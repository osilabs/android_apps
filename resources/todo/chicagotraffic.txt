// Release 0.8

>> STM <<
Config.MAPVIEW_FAVORITES - Holds JSON string of favorites in current session.

Config.CURRENT_MAPVIEW_COORDS - Holds that is the currently active view in the mapview.

renaming preference: 
	pref_favorite_map_frame_1 to 
		pref_mapview_favorites 
		and 
		pref_current_mapview_coords

Created inner class in MapsTab for pointers to keep track of the indexes of the favorites and system menu choices.
- Initializes upon mapstab init().
- Need to change fav_size every time a fav is added or deleted.
- Need to use the right index when a menu option is chosen.

//-- Paid version --//

* What the paid version has: 

** Set a different favorite rss feed in place of city pages A list.

** More weather data (make a second feed in the weather bug rss generator)

** Add cameras to favorites. Maybe only 1 in free version and paid version can have many.

* Clear out all data and it starts on the camera tab and no camera shows up.

* Get rid of defaults in strings.xml. put in config.


// Release 0.7

* Add double-tap to zoom, pinch zoom. (spent 20 mins on this, was seeming like I need to override touch event and very manually handle these. maybe look into it again later since i already have zoom)

* Add hepatic feedback

* When the "Oh No, the internet connectin ..." message comes up, instead, give a big retry icon and tell them to try again when they are near a connection.

// FIXME - check if intent exists
Intent emailIntent = new Intent(android.content.Intent.ACTION_SEND);
emailIntent .setType("plain/text");
emailIntent .setFlags(emailIntent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK);
emailIntent .putExtra(android.content.Intent.EXTRA_EMAIL, new String[]{"tct_app_feedback@osilabs.com"});
emailIntent .putExtra(android.content.Intent.EXTRA_SUBJECT, "** TCT Feedback **");
emailIntent .putExtra(android.content.Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, "Phone:xxx\nTCT Version:yyy\nAndroid Version:zzz\n\nMy Twin Cities Traffic Feedback:\n");
getApplicationContext().startActivity(Intent.createChooser(emailIntent, "Send mail..."));


* Custom 404 page for when the adbanner can't get it's content. This just happened and the ugly default could not find page page is just that. 

* Context menus when you click the maps (scanner, phone numbers, refresh)

* When in landscape mode, the window.scrollTo doesn't put the view in a good place.

* Toast messages in try catach

* choose region (west, northwest,...) then maps center onload to your area

// Ideas

* Your route is figured out from the cameras you chose. They are used to try to tell you if you should avoid that route today. Maybe tap the route icon and up comes a message tailored to you avoiding or taking your route.

* Tap a camera shot, context menu pops up offers 1. next cameras north or west

* Use lat and long on incident feed xml to give realtime update of distance you are from the incident.

* Text to speach will read out loud the Incident Feed.  Does all on the page in succession.

* Incident list screen has cameras in xml feed. Use those to pull up a view of the accident

* On incident map, have a setting that says what one tap of an incident icon does. 1. to incident description or 2. Nearest camera. Long press offers either.

* Build a route: All boils down to telling you if you should avoid the route this morning or not.


>> BUGS <<
// Was recompiling over and over with map view. After a while got this error and had to reboot phone. May be a mapview thing:
	com.android.ddmlib.SyncException: Too many open files
