* This output shows the Config.CURRENT_MAPVIEW_COORDS having the label "Gui". Problem is I deleted that and it was not cleaned out of the Config.CURRENT_MAPVIEW_COORDS. Clean it out upon delete

* Had fav "Dj". Selected it, to get to map from chicago dot map. added new favorite "Test". Open list of maps and selected "Dj" ("test" was in the list). Opened list again and now "test" is gone.  This only happens after a compile, the first time.  Maybe the session.

* The system chicago metro map is showing minneapolis

* Try putting the yellow favorites star drawable in the mapOverlay::draw() method. To get it on top of the upper rh corner of the mapview.

* onstart says: "Current map view coords empty" even thought last time i did anything i was looking at a mapview.  This happens after a compile, maybe always. make sure I am setting that current variable and it is getting put in the session and pulled out onStart();

* Fix this fixme : // FIXME, this size should be figured out first.

* Deleted all favorites, clicked the system Chicago Metro mapview map and it says loading but never pulls it up.

* Had 1 fav. Added another. zoomed out. new fav was gone. ... or something like that

* Recompiled, had no favorites. Added a single favorite from the main map and it won't show up in the menu. But I did get a message that it saved.

* Long press stars to change them

* Still need to wiggle the map to get traffic to draw sometimes

* The counts of favorites have to be rechecked on every onstart just in case the saved pref json strings are unexpectedly deleted or altered.  Must also check they are validate before trying to use them, again, because they are saved on disk and could be corroupt.

* Make sure I finished this
renaming preference: 
	pref_favorite_map_frame_1 to 
		pref_mapview_favorites 
		and 
		pref_current_mapview_coords

>> BUGS <<

* E/Web Console(32486): Uncaught ReferenceError: jumpTo is not defined at :1
* See If I can get maps to just center so I don't have to do a scrollx/y
* Switching from color map (image view) to mapview map doesn't cause traffic overlay to force draw.

//-- Paid version --//

* What the paid version has: 

** Set a different favorite rss feed in place of city pages A list.

** More weather data (make a second feed in the weather bug rss generator)

** Add cameras to favorites. Maybe only 1 in free version and paid version can have many.

* Clear out all data and it starts on the camera tab and no camera shows up.

* Get rid of defaults in strings.xml. put in config.


// Release 0.7

* Add double-tap to zoom, pinch zoom. (spent 20 mins on this, was seeming like I need to override touch event and very manually handle these. maybe look into it again later since i already have zoom)

* Add hepatic feedback

* When the "Oh No, the internet connectin ..." message comes up, instead, give a big retry icon and tell them to try again when they are near a connection.

// FIXME - check if intent exists
Intent emailIntent = new Intent(android.content.Intent.ACTION_SEND);

getApplicationContext().startActivity(Intent.createChooser(emailIntent, "Send mail..."));


* Custom 404 page for when the adbanner can't get it's content. This just happened and the ugly default could not find page page is just that. 

* Context menus when you click the maps (scanner, phone numbers, refresh)

* When in landscape mode, the window.scrollTo doesn't put the view in a good place.

* Toast messages in try catach

* choose region (west, northwest,...) then maps center onload to your area

// Ideas

* Your route is figured out from the cameras you chose. They are used to try to tell you if you should avoid that route today. Maybe tap the route icon and up comes a message tailored to you avoiding or taking your route.

* Tap a camera shot, context menu pops up offers 1. next cameras north or west

* Use lat and long on incident feed xml to give realtime update of distance you are from the incident.

* Text to speach will read out loud the Incident Feed.  Does all on the page in succession.

* Incident list screen has cameras in xml feed. Use those to pull up a view of the accident

* On incident map, have a setting that says what one tap of an incident icon does. 1. to incident description or 2. Nearest camera. Long press offers either.

* Build a route: All boils down to telling you if you should avoid the route this morning or not.

// Was recompiling over and over with map view. After a while got this error and had to reboot phone. May be a mapview thing:
