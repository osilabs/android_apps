* See http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2009/04/backward-compatibility-for-android.html for how to code for backward compatability so it can show up on the market for v1.5 devices.

* Make a feedback options menu option. Just opens email client.

* Make osilabs.com right in 'About' for all apps.

* Game idea: use the crosshairs to have rocklike accuracy and stability. Hang a string of xmas lights and move the cross hairs from one to the next.  10000 points per light. Play to 5 and perfect score is 50000. Points awarded as each player gets as close to FFFFFF as possible. FFFFFE is worth is worth 255,255,254 or just under FFFFFF.

* Get running on g1 and emulator

* Take nice picture of bluejay blue for one of the screenshots. go to borders, find
   a book and take the picture.

>>> Promotional text: "A live color picker. Capture hues through the lens of augmented reality." This requires a large promotional graphic to use but would be good for business.


TESTING

* Different view port sizes: chk logo, decor positions
* 

>>> TERMINOLOGY <<<
* A live color picker.  Augmented Reality color picker. Live Dropper.
* Live Color Sampler. Camera Dropper. 
* "Get the color!"

Graphic Designers, web designers, forensics, colorblind



>>> Black Screen Bug <<<

* Again, I had the exact same issue.  Black screen in camera, would not work even after getting cell signal as long as the camera was turned on when I had limited or no signal.  Turning off geotaging and rebooting the phone solved the problem.  I have not had one camera black screen issue since turning off this option.

* I *think* this is caused by the Droid/Milestone not liking the default 
previewFrameRate that Android sets. Try setting that to one of the values 
specified by getSupportedPreviewFrameRates(). 

* You need to call setPreviewDisplay in surfaceChanged. 
And the app shouldn't call setPreviewSize with arbitrary numbers because not 
every device support 240x160. Use getPreviewSize in 1.6 or use 
getSupportedPreviewSizes in 2.0.

* Yes. You still need to do that. If applications do not call 
setPreviewDisplay, camera drivers may not start the preview even if 
startPreview is called. Ex: the current implementation on Droid.

* Need feedback util. Make a box on web site, write to db table.

* link for where to donate. Multiple ways. 
	1. buy the donate app. 
	2. Encourage to buy another osilabs app that costs money.

* Put up a quick decoration on the drop sample showing a scale which 
   will later be used to show current level of light boost or drop.

* Make beta download mobile site and link in livedropper. There 
   the latest build can downloaded.

* Turn "training" of feature. With every drop, can ask you if it was brighter, darker, too red, too green too blue, needs more r|g|or b, too grey, not grey enough.

* Menu option with paid version to get beta. Which is a link to the most current build out there. May have new features for users to try out, maybe even need them, and git me feedback b4 the next major release.

* Touch screen, slider pops up for brightness. 
    tap anywhere, slider is on left, just slide 
    up or down from where you are.

* Take the multiple colors that define a sample region, be able to provide a drop made up of multiple colors coming together but at different amounts.  For example, instead of an rgb of the pixel of a skin color sample, take a 3x3 region sample of the skin, with 

* Create a donation ability

* Click capture, adjust hues, read value, return to camera

* onDraw()is redrawing the decorations with every frame, should only do once.

* Color the cross hairs an inverse/negative of the color being sampled. Or fix the complimentry color thing.

* Turn on light

* Get the website on GIT
