// Ideas

* Incident list screen has cameras in xml feed. Use those to pull up a view of the accident

* Tilt screen to switch view.  configure what view you get when vert and horriz. Default is 'traffic' for vert, camera for horriz.

* Save settings: choose and save default camera shot for quick view

* On incident map, have a setting that says what one tap of an incident icon does. 1. to incident description or 2. Nearest camera. Long press offers either.

* add a button for my saved default camera shot

// todo


* When in landscape mode, the window.scrollTo doesn't put the view in a good place.

* in onstart or oncreate throw up a toast saying shit is loading.

* Build a route: All boils down to telling you if you should avoid the route this morning or not.

* When orientation vert, spinner at bottom, when horriz, spinner goes to right of ad at top.

* Shake phone to refresh maps (settings to set sensitivity of this or disable)

* Use google checkout to collect payments
* Track amounts from each grantor
* Hidden grantor name and display name.  Display name may be 'Anonymous'.
* Grantor can seed money, let interest accumulate, then request original amount back. If interest is not made and value becomes less than original value, only original value can be returned. Value is paid back to the credit card used in google checkout to assure money is going back to orininator.
* Use EAV for settings/metadata about each child and grantor.
