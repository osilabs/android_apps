* Custom 404 page for when the adbanner can't get it's content. This just happened and the ugly default could not find page page is just that. 

* Context menus when you click the maps (scanner, phone numbers, refresh)

* Toast messages in try catach

* Add phone numbers (511) somewhere

* choose region (west, northwest,...) then maps center onload to your area


??????

* Choosing to configure cameras, or saving a camera, or loading all can take a long time after the toast message goes away

// Ideas

* Your route is figured out from the cameras you chose. They are used to try to tell you if you should avoid that route today. Maybe tap the route icon and up comes a message tailored to you avoiding or taking your route.

* Tap a camera shot, context menu pops up offers 1. next cameras north or west

* Use lat and long on incident feed xml to give realtime update of distance you are from the incident.

* Text to speach will read out loud the Incident Feed.  Does all on the page in succession.

* Incident list screen has cameras in xml feed. Use those to pull up a view of the accident

* Tilt screen to switch view.  configure what view you get when vert and horriz. Default is 'traffic' for vert, camera for horriz.

* Save settings: choose and save default camera shot for quick view

* On incident map, have a setting that says what one tap of an incident icon does. 1. to incident description or 2. Nearest camera. Long press offers either.

// todo


* in onstart or oncreate throw up a toast saying shit is loading.

* Build a route: All boils down to telling you if you should avoid the route this morning or not.

* Shake phone to refresh maps (settings to set sensitivity of this or disable)
