* Use google checkout to collect payments
* Track amounts from each grantor
* Hidden grantor name and display name.  Display name may be 'Anonymous'.
* Grantor can seed money, let interest accumulate, then request original amount back. If interest is not made and value becomes less than original value, only original value can be returned. Value is paid back to the credit card used in google checkout to assure money is going back to orininator.
* Use EAV for settings/metadata about each child and grantor.
